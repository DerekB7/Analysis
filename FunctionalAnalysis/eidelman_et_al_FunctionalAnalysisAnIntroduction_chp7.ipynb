Since Theorem 7.3.3 does not depend on Theorem 7.3.1. or or Theorem 7.3.2 it would seem my argument gives a standalone way of describing closed intervals only containing regular points, and Theorem 7.3.1 characterizes eigenvalues which then implies Theorem 7.3.2 [i.e. $E_\\lambda$ being continuous but not locally constant] as continuous spectrum is the only thing left for self-adjoint [bounded] operators [recall ex 6.5.9].
